    "description": "Okazaki Tomoya is a third year high school student at Hikarizaka Private High School, leading a life full of resentment. His mother passed away in a car accident when he was young, leading his father, Naoyuki, to resort to alcohol and gambling to cope. This resulted in constant fights between the two until Naoyuki dislocated Tomoya’s shoulder. Unable to play on his basketball team, Tomoya began to distance himself from other people. Ever since he has had a distant relationship with his father, naturally becoming a delinquent over time.\n\nWhile on a walk to school, Tomoya meets a strange girl named Furukawa Nagisa, questioning if she likes the school at all. He finds himself helping her, and as time goes by, Tomoya finds his life heading towards a new direction.",

    "description": "Hoshina Shuuji has a secret: He has a mysterious power that allows him to perceive the emotions of others.\n\nOne of Shuuji’s classmates, Ayachi Nene, likewise has her own grave secret: She will randomly experience periods of strong arousal, something which she has no control over. The two of them had nothing to do with one another beyond just being classmates, until one day, when Shuuji stumbled upon a scene that defied his wildest imaginations. Ayachi Nene, THAT Ayachi Nene is pressing her crotch against the corner of a library table… using it to MASTURBATE?!\n\nFollowing that one accident, two strangers became friends. They bonded with one another through their shared secrets, and from this, Shuuji came to learn about certain things. That is, not only about the reason for Nene’s random ‘fits’ where she gets uncontrollably aroused, but also about the existence of people called ‘witches’—-Nene’s secret actions as a ‘witch’, and the ‘fits’ she goes through because of that serving as the magnet, a junior, an upperclassman, and a transfer student all congregate together.\n\nShuuji’s once normal life is thrown into chaos, and with that, a certain faint hope wells up inside of him:\n\n“Maybe this will be the start of something new.”\n\n[From [url=https://sanobawitch.nekonyansoft.com/]NekoNyan[/url]]"
